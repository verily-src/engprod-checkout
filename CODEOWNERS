# Rules marked as ENFORCED are required, and will be re-applied if removed
# or overridden.
#
# Tips and gotchas:
#
# * Adding multiple teams allows any member on any team to approve,
#   rather than requiring a review from all teams.
#
# * Make sure all rules specify more than one user,
#   as they will be unable to review their own PRs.
#
# * Specifying a @user before their team has the effect of
#   making them the "default" reviewer for that rule.
#
# * Do not reference a user by their email unless you are
#   sure it has been added it to their GitHub account.
#
# * Referenced teams must have write access to the repository.
#
# * Order is important - only the last matching rule is applied.
#   For this reason, * should always be the first rule.

# ENFORCED: Catch-all rule protecting all files by default.

# ENFORCED: Workflows required by all repositories are owned by @verily-src/verily-engprod.
